# pilsner
This is a work in progress to create a binding to the pils library for blender.

## Install
Put pilsner.py to your startup scripts. If you use blender on a mac, the correct
path is `/Applications/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/scripts/startup`. The
version number may of course be different on your installation.
